# AniTracker

This website serves as Patrick Conboy's senior project. The project's goal was to implement a website similar to MyAnimeList that fixed a lot of the issues MAL had.

This website currently only runs locally and isn't being hosted online. 
Details on how to run the website locally in the wiki mentioned below.
